    "_Heads up: Running this part will cost ~\\\\$3.4 (generations with the models cost ~ \\\\$0.02). Changing the evaluation model to its non-reasoning version DeepSeek-V3 will reduce the cost of running the model to ~\\\\$0.5, but can slightly decrease the reliability of evaluation._\n",

    "The evaluation procedure in text generation tasks is not as straightforward as in classification tasks. This is because the task can have multiple correct outputs for the given input. For example, in our task, in the input text \"The team leader which I spoke to yesterday, ...\", the word \"which\" can be corrected to \"who\" and \"whom\", and both options are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the procedure of evaluation highly depends on the nature of the task. In some cases, for example, story generation, one would have to ask an LLM to verify every generated story against the input data. For other tasks like sentence paraphrasing, some generated paraphrases may coincide with the reference ones, removing the need to run LLM on these coinciding cases. Still, for almost any text generation task, some cases need to be evaluated either with a human's or an LLM's help. We can again leverage Nebius AI Studio to run the evaluator LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take the test set of the JFLEG dataset[4], used for evaluation of grammatic error correction systems. Each instance is a sentence that contains 4 corrections from 4 language experts. Some corrections may coincide with the original sentence if the sentence is grammatically correct. The dataset contains spaces before the punctuation marks - we'll remove them to have the data in human-like format.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our task, grammatic error correction, we can also leverage its peculiarities to simplify the evaluation and reduce the number of cases where the results depend on another LLM's verdict.\n",
    "We will use the following pipeline. After we generate corrections with the fine-tuned and baseline models, we will compare these corrections with the reference corrections. If a model generation coincides with at least one expert correction, we will consider it valid. If it doesn't, and the model generation introduces no edits to the original text, this means an error since all the experts suggested corrections. Finally, if none of the conditions above is met, we will ask a powerful LLM to assess whether the correction suggested by the model is correct or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the baseline model is not that large (14B parameters) and it was not trained to generate data in the desired format, it can sometimes fail to strictly follow the output format. Hence, we'll use extended instructions with few-shot learning examples to guide it to output the results in the desired format - the system prompt we used to distill Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already discussed, we will use both models in non-reasoning mode to simulate their real-world application where the result should be generated on the fly."
